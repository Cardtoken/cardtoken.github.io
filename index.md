# Welcome to Cardtoken.io
The following guide outlines the steps to get started. Cardtoken.io is multi-provider service offered via a restful API.

## Model
A tenant can have multiple merchants. A merchant can have multiple cards. A merchant can have multiple gateways. A card can have multiple vendor tokens, based on the number of gateways.

## Supported Gateways

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.
